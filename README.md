# Urban Box

A collection of python tools developed to measure, estimate and allocate urban growth. Named in after [George E. P. Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E._P._Box), the English statistician who popularised the aphorism ["all models are wrong"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong). This recognises the limitations of urban modelling and seeks to situate the use of these models in a broader democratic dialog about the what we collectivly desire for the future of our towns, cities and regions. Urban models are not decision making tools, they are decision *support* tools.
